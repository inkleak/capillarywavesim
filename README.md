#  Capillary Wave Simulation
2nd year University Project to simulate capillary waves on the surface of liquids.

This project was conducted in the first half of 2023 as part of my penultimate year of studies. My role in the experiment was the computational physicist, which made me responsible for creating a simulation of capillary waves dependent on properties of the fluid (i.e: Surface Tension, Temperature)

Attached is a Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) file, detailing the modelling done. Most of what has done in this experiment has been theoretically derived before, however this was still a very interesting project.
